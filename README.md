# Only direct video for Youtube

This is a little Javascript snippet that can be used to remove suggestions, comments and anything distracting from Youtube. Only the video and the title are shown. With this script you can only watch videos via a direct link. Every other youtube page that shows not a single video is redirected.

# How to install

Install a custom js extension for your browser. I use the "User javascript and css" extension for the chrome browser. Then create a rule for youtube.com and paste the script into the custom js field. Also enable jQuery for the rule in it's settings.
